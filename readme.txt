SolarWolf is an action/arcade game written entirely in Python.
It is entirely opensource and free.
It is released under the LGPL license. 
 
It features quick and smooth fullscreen 800x600 graphics. There
is alpha transparent blitting, colorkeying, animated sprites,
scrolling starfield background, antialiased font rendering, and
more. The sound system supports multiple sound channel playback,
along with streaming music support. It also supports input from
keyboard or joystick. 
 
The game and its dependencies are extremely cross platform,
allowing gameplay on just about all platforms; Windows, Linux,
BeOS, IRIX, Solaris, NT4, OSX, and more. 
 
SolarWolf is built with Pygame. This library is a great set of
modules for game development in python, with a growing community
of users. It provides a "pythonic" object oriented interface for
the fantastic SDL media library. 
 
The game is originally based of one of my childhood favorites,
SolarFox on the Atari 2600. 
 
All this, yet the best feature of all is; It is a hecka lotta fun!
The point of the game is to scramble through 48 levels of patterns,
collecting all the boxes. The part that makes it tricky is avoiding
the relentless hailstorm of fire coming at you from all directions.
